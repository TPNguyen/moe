Misspelling Oblivious Word Embeddings

We are releasing the misspellings dataset consists of a set of pairs (w<sub>m</sub>, w<sub>e</sub>), where w<sub>e</sub> represents a (pre-sumably correctly spelled) word from and w<sub>m</sub> is a misspelling of w<sub>e</sub>. 
For more details about the dataset, please check our paper [Misspelling Oblivious Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09755) published at NAACL 2019.
